The line expanded_features = np.expand_dims(img) 
is used to add an extra dimension to the image array. 
In many machine learning frameworks, including Keras and TensorFlow, 
models expect input data to be in a specific shape or format.

In this case, the ResNet50 model expects input images to have a 
shape of (batch_size, height, width, channels), where:

batch_size: The number of images being processed simultaneously. 
This dimension allows models to process multiple images in parallel for efficiency.
height: The height of the image.
width: The width of the image.
channels: The number of color channels in the image (e.g., 3 for RGB images).
The np.expand_dims(img) function is used to add an extra dimension 
to the image array to match the required shape. By default, 
np.expand_dims() adds a new axis at position 0,
 effectively converting a 3D array (representing the image) to a 4D array. 
 This additional dimension represents the batch size, 
 even if it's just a single image being processed.

So, the purpose of expanding the dimension is to make the 
input image compatible with the input shape expected by the model.
 It's a common preprocessing step when feeding images into neural networks,
  ensuring that the model processes the data correctly.
